This is a from scratch project for Spring 2017 Comprehensive XML class.
* There are source XML files in xml-source.
* XSLT transformation files are in xsl-files (along with generated html, it's hard to find a user friendly processor to do this yourself but I used saxonHE)
* Schema documents are in validation
* XQuery queries located in queries folder (also used saxon for this)
